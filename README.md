# Odin Facebook

The challenge is to create a working facebook clone with the the underlying database and controller structures, but not the realtime notifications (i.e. backend focused).  It's a learning exercise set by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project?ref=lnav).

I've added somethings on the way.  

## Gravatars
It turns out you can use interesting default images that vary by user and always stay the same for that user (based one email) if the user doesn't have an image.
